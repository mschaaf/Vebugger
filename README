Vebugger is yet another debugger frontend plugin for Vim, created because I wasn't happy with the other debugger plugins I found. Vebugger currently supports GDB, JDB, Mdbg, PDB and RDebug.

Vebugger is developed under Linux. It doesn't work properly under Windows due to lack of PTY support. I have neither plans nor means to support OSX, but I will accept pull requests that add OSX support.
